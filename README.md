# hello-world

Hi,
My name is Bryce King. I am a Master's student at Indiana University studying Economics with a concentration in Game Theory. 
I have started this github repo in an effort to test my skills in coding and github. I have used both of these tools in the past without ever really understanding how they work. This is my attempt at furthering my knowledge in this area.

Sincerely,
Bryce King
